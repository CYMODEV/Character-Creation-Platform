# Cymos Character Creation Platform

A modular, full‑stack implementation of the Cymos character ecosystem: registry‑anchored characters, licensing, quests, vault yield proxies, and a Character Stock Exchange Index (CSEI) dashboard.

## Modules
- API (Express + Prisma): characters, licenses, quests, governance, index
- Web (React + Vite): creator UI, steward review, license panel, quest board, index dashboard
- Contracts (Solidity + Hardhat): registry, vault, governance (MVP)

## Run locally
1. pnpm install
2. docker compose up -d db
3. pnpm -C apps/api prisma:migrate
4. pnpm dev:api
5. pnpm dev:web

## API endpoints
- POST /characters
- GET /characters
- GET /characters/:id
- POST /characters/:id/metrics/recompute
- POST /licenses
- POST /licenses/:id/report
- POST /quests
- POST /quests/:id/proof
- GET /index/prime

## Notes
- CPS and vault yield are simplified proxies; wire to real revenue feeds and governance signals.
- Smart contracts are MVP examples for registry/vault/governance — integrate wallets and distribution logic for production.
